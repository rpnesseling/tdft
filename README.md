Experimenting is fine, but not for profit. 

If you've been scammed also mail me with the details. there are no intermediate sellers.

No idea what to do here! Sorry for not responding

edit2: I would love to have the field theorem published and would love for Oxford to do so.
I'm still having problems contacting most of the outside world
