To fix py0 to py1 and back. The case of missing zero's

Example: Earth's rotation
F0 = 32 is earth rotation per half hour = O over assumed ST 
T1 = F0
S2 = 32^-2 = 16 
ST3 = 32^-3 = 0

F0 /= ST3 is false

Pay attention: Sqrt (^-2) is a non sum.division 
and or Sqc (^-1 + ^-2 + ^-3) is a sum.division

F0 = -Fn = 32 
-S2 = 32 ^ -1 + 32 ^ -2 = 48 or Sphere over Qube = 32 ^ -1 + 32 ^ -2 = 48
-ST3 = (32 ^ -1) + (32 ^ -2) + (32 ^ -3) = 48
-ST3^0^1 = (32 ^ -1) + (32 ^ -2) + (32 ^ -3) = 48
-?4 = (32 ^ -1) + (32 ^ -2) + (32 ^ -3) + (32 ^ -4) = ?48 

From T(32) to S(48) to ST(48) = 0 = false
Suggested T(48) because of T = S = ST
Assumption Use of Sqrt(^-2) otherwise Sqc(^-1 + ^-2) 
messed up 3d to 2d calculations 
or earth rotation in half hours was measured using visual position over 
next visual position creating 10 degrees offset because of olyps orbit of Earth.
or earth rotation was measured using oppposing force
to break spin momemtun of Earth's rotation and possbly forgetting 
about the angle of rotation explaining 10 degrees offset.

Speed of sound 700m/s = N720 * 48 * 700 = false as ST =/ F
Speed of sound 720m/s = N720 * 48 * 720 = true as T = S = ST 
Speed of sound in D-algebra = N720^0 = 48^1 = 720^3 = 1 = true

Example to compare truancy:
pluto takes a supposed 8 months to return from it's assumed trip around 
the invisible, ftl spin, black hole at the center if the universe.
8 / 32 = 1/5 = false
8 / 48 = 1/8 = true

Inconclusion: Pluto really goes away for 8 months around (a) black hole.
Rotation of earth is a corrected (or not depending on source) 48 (per no unit).

Conclusion: Sqrt is implemented wrong for an unknown ammount of sources. 
Assume every source is wrong for almost every calculation.
Problem in use (^-2) vs. (^-1 + ^-2 + ^-3). 

Next step. Correct for Speed of light
 
Sp.o.l    = 300000 (assumed)
Sp.o.l^32 = 1,853020189x10^175
Sp.o.l.aT = 1,853020189x10???^-1 = 0
Sp.o.l.aS = 1,853020189x10???^-2 = 0
Sp.o.l.aST= 1,853020189x10???^-3 = 0

Truancy (0=1) of F^n division of 300000 km/s

Corrected
F0 = 48
Fm = S.o.L = F(48)^1 F(48)^2 F(48)^3 = 112944

Side step to affirm falsehood truancy with correcting:
S.o.l corrected for wrongly assumed spin of earth as 0.32 per half hour
Sp.o.l = (300000 / 30) * 32 = 32000

F0 = 48 is per full orbit around the sun (assumption)
Sp.o.l = F(48)^1 F(48)^2 F(48)^3 = 2835 per full orbit 
.. 2835 ^ 48 = 136080 per 1/48 orbit. 2 earth days is one sun (sol) day.
Preposition: Sol native 1 day = soln1 = 136080 km/s   

Ammendum
The Earth's ffv is actually 48 because it is a Earth/Moon combo. With a shared negative circle gravitational point.
The ffv is also calculated from the entire diamater of both Earth and Moon and in between.
