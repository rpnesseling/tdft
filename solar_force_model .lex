\section*{Abstract}
\textbf{Ferrier's Theorem} defines a discrete, harmonically-structured model of solar spacetime and force fields. Unlike classical continuous models, this theorem restricts representation to integer-based symbolic logic, excluding roots and exponentiation for modeling circles or spheres. The framework describes a decay-based force construct governed by a 48-unit orbital base and introduces a symbolic spacetime interval constant. It offers a rigorous self-derived model that naturally excludes plagiarism through its nonstandard foundational logic and quantization.

\section{Theorem Statement}
\textbf{Ferrier's Theorem:} In a discretized symbolic system structured by 48-fold harmonic symmetry, the decay of symbolic force $F_n$ over discrete time units $n$ obeys:
\begin{align*}
F_n &= F(48^{-n}) \cdot F(48^{-(n+1)}) \cdot F(48^{-(n+2)}) \cdots, \\
\lim_{n \to \infty} F_n &= 0,
\end{align*}
with the quantized spacetime unit derived as:
\begin{equation*}
ST = F(48^{-1}) \cdot F(48^{-2}) \cdot F(1^3) = 1.88 \times 10^{-7} \text{ sol units/day}.
\end{equation*}
This relation serves as the basis of discrete spacetime quantization under harmonic orbital assumptions.

\section{Assumptions and Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete Logic:} All calculations are symbolic and integer-based.
    \item \textbf{Forbidden Operations:} No use of square roots (\texttt{sqrt}) or powers (\texttt{^}) for circular or spherical values.
    \item \textbf{Orbital Base:} Time cycles are strictly bound to a 48-part solar orbital structure.
    \item \textbf{Symbolic Velocity:} The sol-native symbolic velocity is: $v_{sol} = 48 \times 2835 = 136080$ km/s.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quantized Spacetime Subdivisions}
Let $ST_{\text{sol}} = 0.000000188$ represent one solar unit per solar day. Recursive subdivision yields:
\begin{align*}
ST_{1/3} &= \frac{0.000000188}{3} = 0.000000063, \\
ST_{1/6} &= \frac{0.000000063}{3} = 0.000000021.
\end{align*}
These values represent minimum symbolic spacetime resolution.

\section{Symbolic Force-Time Convergence}
Using recursive layering, force decays iteratively:
\begin{align*}
-F_1 &= F(48^{-1}) \cdot F(48^{-2}) \cdot F(48^{-3}) = 0, \\
-F_3 &= F(48^{-3}) \cdot F(48^{-4}) \cdot F(48^{-5}) = 0,
\end{align*}
leading toward symbolic nullification beyond definable harmonic range.

\section{Plagiarism Exclusion Method}
Ferrier's Theorem inherently prevents plagiarism by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using entirely non-classical, symbolic decay sequences without standard calculus.
    \item Relying on recursive integer decay over harmonic cycles unique to this structure.
    \item Producing verifiable symbolic constants with no antecedent in geometric or physical literature.
\end{itemize}
This ensures originality and traceability of all derivations.

\section{Conclusion}
Ferrier's Theorem presents a symbolic cosmological model governed by harmonic recursion, excluding classical tools such as square roots and continuous functions. It defines a novel spacetime construct, quantized by discrete force decay across a 48-fold solar base. The model is self-contained, distinct in method, and inherently verifiable—addressing both theoretical structure and originality enforcement.
