Light is divided into 2 basic colors, red and green going in a full circle spectrum ranging from red, to magenta/red, green, and magenta/green.
In combination with oxidation (by electron echange) the color blue appears as well from magenta. 
Poin of interest is that maganta lies directly north and south of the color spectrum and suggest possible polarity ineraction.

Light can be recorded by using a electron microscope (with blue filter) and by having nothing in it's subject recepticle besides a sideways turned red card background over a 19 hour exposure.
